# EEG-BIDS

The EEG-BIDS (formerly known as **BIDS-MATLAB-tools**) repository contains a collection of functions that import and export BIDS-formated experiments. The code is tailored for use as an [EEGLAB](http://eeglab.org) plugin but may also be used independently of EEGLAB. Conversion of data format from non-supported BIDS binary format requires that EEGLAB be installed (supported formats are EEGLAB .set files, EDF files, BDF files, and Brain Vision Exchange Format files).

# Documentation

Refer to the [wiki documentation](https://github.com/sccn/EEG-BIDS/wiki) or the submenus of this plugin if you are on the EEGLAB website.

# EEG-BIDS vs other BIDS software

[BIDS-MATLAB](https://bids-matlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a project to import BIDS data. BIDS-MATLAB maps the BIDS directory architectures to MATLAB structures but does not import or convert data like EEG-BIDS. In theory, EEG-BIDS could use BIDS-MATLAB to get the BIDS directory architectures into MATLAB and then convert it to an EEGLAB STUDY. However, in 2021, BIDS-MATLAB could not yet import all the relevant EEG, MEG, and iEEG files. 

[EEG2BIDS](https://github.com/aces/EEG2BIDS) is a Python-based executable that formatted a collection of EDF files in BIDS format. EEG2BIDS requires users to create JSON files for meta-data. It is a tool designed to archive data as part of a lab protocol where JSON files have been prepared in advance and are suited for technicians organizing data. EEG-BIDS export capabilities are more suited for researchers managing their data and are agnostic regarding the original data format.

[ezBIDS](https://brainlife.io/ezbids/) is a data export tool for MRI and fMRI data. It does not allow to export EEG data to our knowledge.

[data2bids.m](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/example/bids/) is a Fieldtrip function to export BIDS data. This includes EEG and maybe fMRI. This function can only be used from the command line.

[EEG-BIDS](https://github.com/sccn/EEG-BIDS) (this program) is the most popular tool to export EEG data using both a graphical interface and/or command line (more than half of the BIDS datasets on OpenNeuro were exported using EEG-BIDS and it has more than 2200 installs in EEGLAB). A compiled stand-alone version will also be released soon.

# Standalone version

A standalone version of the plugin is available when [downloading EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php). The standalone plugin version is distributed with EEGLAB because it uses EEGLAB resources. After download EEGLAB, use the executable named EEGBIDS (Mac) or EEGBIDS.bat (Windows). This version of EEG-BIDS does not require a paid MATLAB license.

# EEG-BIDS export capabilities

Accepted EEG input formats are all files that EEGLAB can read. 

* EEG export: ✔ (as .set, .edf, .bdf, or .vhmk files)
* iEEG export: ✔ (as .set, .edf or .nwb)

* BEH export: ✔
* MRI export: ✔ (no conversion)
* fMRI export: ✖
* Motion-cap export: ✖ (upcoming)
* EMG export: ✖ (upcoming)
* MEG export: ✖ (upcoming)

# EEG-BIDS import capabilities for EEGLAB

EEG-BIDS allows importing BIDS datasets into EEGLAB. This is the type of information that can be imported.

* EEG import: ✔ (all formats)
* iEEG import: ✔ (all formats)
* MEG import: ✔ (.ds and .fif files supported, more formats upcoming)
* Eye-tracking import: ✖ (upcoming)
* HED import: ✔
* BEH import: ✔
* MRI import: n/a
* fMRI import: n/a
* Motion-cap import: ✔ (beta)
* EMG import: ✖ (upcoming)

# Cloning

Make sure you clone with submodules

```
git clone https://github.com/sccn/EEG-BIDS
```

# Testing 

Use the EEG-BIDS_testcases repository for testing

```
git clone https://github.com/sccn/EEG-BIDS_testcases.git
```

# Use with EEGLAB

Simply place the code in the EEGLAB plugin folder, and EEGLAB will automatically detect it. See documentation at [https://github.com/sccn/EEG-BIDS/wiki](https://github.com/sccn/EEG-BIDS/wiki).
